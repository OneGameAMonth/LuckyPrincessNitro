# Lucky Princess Nitro

[January project](http://ambethia.com/lucky-princess-nitro) for [#1gameamonth](http://www.onegameamonth.com/).

A very basic "shoot 'em up" written in JRuby using the awesome [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) engine. The implementation includes my first attempt at using an [entity system](http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/).
